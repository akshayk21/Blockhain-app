Thus, to successfully tamper with a blockchain, one needs to tamper with all the blocks on the chain, redo the proof-of-work for all the blocks and take control of more than 50% of the peer-to-peer network. Only then the tampered block will be accepted by everyone else in the chain. This is almost impossible to achieve. Blockchains are also constantly evolving.

The concept of Bitcoin peaked a lot of interest in the technology and people have realized that this technology can be used for a number of other applications like storing medical records, creation of a digital notary or even collecting taxes.
